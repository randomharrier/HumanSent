HUMANSENT
========

HumanSent turns digital messages into real, handwritten postcards created by real humans.
Slow on purpose.

The laws (non-negotiable):
1) No instant delivery. Every message must be physically mailed.
2) All handwriting is real. No fonts, no robots, no plotters.
3) Photos must be taken live in-app. Zero preview. Not from camera roll.
4) Messages cannot be edited once sent. No undo. No recall.
5) No digital copies stored after writing. If it exists, it exists as a physical card only.

If you’re here because you want instant delivery:
We respect you. But we’re building the opposite.
